# 💻 How to Use Git and GitHub
To access the repository files and save them on your computer, there are two methods available:
1. **Using Git Bash and Cloning the Repository**
   - This method is more suitable for advanced users and those familiar with command-line tools.
   - By using this method, you can easily receive updates for the repository.

2. **Downloading the Repository as a ZIP file**
   - This method is simpler and suitable for users who are not comfortable with command-line tools.
   - Note that with this method, you will not automatically receive updates for the repository and will need to manually download any new updates.

## Clone using the URL.
First, open **Git Bash** :
-  Open the folder in **File Explorer** where you want the library to be stored.
-  **Right-click** inside the folder and select the option **"Open Git Bash here"** to open **Git Bash** in that directory.

![open Git Bash](Images/Step0.png)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.  
> You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
> For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/eBoard_USBtoTTL.git
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.
